<h2><b>History Of The Jehangir Art Gallery</b></h2> 
<p>The gallery was inaugurated on 21 January 1952, by then Chief Minister of Bombay State, B. G. Kher and dedicated it to the memory of Sir Cowasji's late son, Jehangir. A mammoth institution in itself, its history is linked with the renaissance of Indian art. The complex also has the popular cafe of Samovar, which is reminiscent of the 1970s socialist culture. It also houses Natesans, the country's oldest licensed antique dealers. Entry is free.These galery was made by Mohit in 1850.
</p>
<p>Lodged in the historic Kala Ghoda neighborhood of South Mumbai is the Jehangir Art Gallery, one of Mumbai’s premier and oldest art institutions. The landmark gallery has hosted exhibitions by India’s leading artists, and has continually served as a prestigious platform for budding students since its establishment in 1952.
The Jehangir Art Gallery was founded with donations given by Sir Cowasji Jehangir, 2nd Baronet, at a time when Mumbai had few institutions to promote its indigenous artists. The gallery, named after Sir Coswaji’s late son, Jehangir, became a regular haunt of many aspiring and struggling artists soon after its inauguration in 1952 by then-Chief Minister, Mr. B.G. Kher. Frequenters of the gallery included the likes of M.F. Husain and S.H. Raza – artists who spearheaded India’s contemporary arts movement.
Jehangir’s establishment in Kala Ghoda contributed to the neighborhood’s evolution as a center for arts and culture. With the National Gallery of Modern Arts, The Arts Trust, numerous art galleries, pavement art stalls, designer boutiques and cafés playing second home to artists from the city, Kala Ghoda is dubbed the ‘art district’ of Mumbai today. It is also home to the annual Kala Ghoda Arts Festival, one of Mumbai’s liveliest arts and culture festivals.

Today, the gallery includes four primary halls equipped to exhibit different mediums of visual arts – an Auditorium hall, an Exhibition Gallery, the Hirji Jehangir Gallery and the Terrace Art Gallery for Photography and Visual Art.  The Gallery hosts over 300 shows a year, and even sponsors an annual exhibition called the Monsoon Art Show to showcase work of emerging local artists. Exhibition slots at the gallery are extremely competitive, with artists being required to apply at least a year in advance.
Over the years, the gallery has hosted exhibitions by India’s most influential artists, including A. Ramachandran, Akbar Padamsee, Ram Kumar, M.F. Husain, Anjolie Ela Menon, S.K. Bakre, S.H. Raza, K.G. Subramanyan and K.K. Hebbar. Just as the gallery served as a platform to inspire and support many of these artists, the Jehangir Art Gallery still remains at the forefront of institutions that promote local artists and students. Still a regular haunt of art students and budding artists, the gallery’s surrounding pavements – where artists from 
around the country display their work – are testament to the importance of the place in India’s arts scene.

<h2><p>AboutPast</p></h2>
<p>The Jehangir Art Gallery, founded by Sir Cowasji Jehagir is one of the most well known galleries in the country, funded by Sir Cowasji himself. Built in 1952 the art gallery as a classic piece of architecture, has been well maintained and managed. The venue has four exhibition halls. The art galleries structure is one of the earliest that were designed in the city.While the unique inward looking art gallery might not be left without questioning in todays development of architecture standards, it stands as an example of an early modernist notions. The structure is such that it combines an art gallery and an acoustic set-up of an auditorium as well.
</p>
<p>
The country’s popular and oldest Natesan's, the antique jewellers are right here at the the premises of the art gallery. The very popular Samovar cafe is also situated on the campus of the gallery. Entry fee for the Jehangir Art Gallery is free. While there are many art galleries in the city, this is one of the quaint galleries with the stone mansion adding charm to the mood.

<h2><b>Architecture</b></h2>
<p>The building has been designed by Durga Bajpai and is one of the early concrete structures in the city. The gallery has been turned inwards due to a combined function of an auditorium and an art gallery. Although the concept of an introvert art gallery could be questioned today, the Jehangir is an example of an early modernist notion of the inward looking art galleries in the city. Moreover, the function of the auditorium left no scope for the gallery to be open to the street. The play with concrete can be easily seen with a large wavy cantilevered entrance which embraces the street. The otherwise bland facade is articulated with relief stone cladding.
